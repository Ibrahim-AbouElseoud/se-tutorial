## Tutorial Content

Angualr has a very good tutorial on their site that teaches all the concepts, however it relyies on knowing a bit more then we tought you, for that reason we collected these micro tutorials to help you get started with angualr (they follow the lecture examples)

remember to lookup what you don't know the dev documetnation for stuff like angular, mongoose are pretty good don't just rely on stackoverfllow having all the answers.

You can use c9.io for these small project in case you're on a lab computer (due ot internet connection)
